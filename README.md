# Diary App

## I have coded a diary application in C#.
Technologies I use
- C#

My goal was to code a diary that includes a search feature so that users can safely save their logs, back them up, and easily find them in case of forgetfulness. Unlike other alternatives, I added a login feature with the option of a username and password for security purposes, and relaxing frequency musics to make you feel comfortable while writing the diary.

## What I Learned
* Opening a form in a form and transferring the form to a different project.
* Adding Windows frameworks to the project (I added the media player in the project).
* Ability to transfer all errors that may occur in my project to a single form and show the error source.

Anyone who is interested in C# language can use this application comfortably.
